I'm Zhengyuan Li, currently a master's student in computer science at UIUC under the guidance of Professor [Liangyan Gui](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/department-faculty/lgui). 
I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Tsinghua University, where I was fortunate to work with Professor [Chongjie Zhang](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Chongjie-Zhang.html). 

I'm interested in human motion synthesis.
